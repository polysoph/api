  title: Viability of Basic Income in the USA
  description: |
    We’d like to fund a study on basic income—giving people enough money to live on with no strings attached. Although there’s been a lot of discussion, there’s little data about how it would work.

    Most nations have systems in place to give people resources, but bureaucratic and qualification requirements make it a very imperfect approximation of what most people mean when talking about a basic income. We have some examples of something close to a basic income in other countries, but we’d like to see how it would work in the US.
