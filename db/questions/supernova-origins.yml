  The P vs. NP problem asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly _verified_ by a computer can also be quickly _solved_ by a computer. First mentioned in a letter between Kurt Gödel to John von Neumann, Gödel asked whether a certain NP-complete problem could be solved in quadratic or linear time. The precise statement of the P versus NP problem was introduced in 1971 by Stephen Cook in his seminal paper "The complexity of theorem proving procedures."
