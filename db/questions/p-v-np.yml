  If a problem's solution can be quickly _verified_ by a computer, can it also be _solved_ quickly?
description: |

  In computer science, algorithms can be broken into two categories of complexity: polynomial algorithms (P), whose efficiency can be modeled , and non-deterministic polynomial functions (NP), whose efficiency can't be modeled. P problems are easily solved by computers, and NP problems are not easily solvable, but if you present a potential solution it’s easy to verify whether it’s correct or not.

  All P problems are NP problems. That is, if it’s easy for the computer to solve, it’s easy to verify the solution. The P vs NP problem is a long-standing problem in computer science that asks if these two problem types are the same, or if they are different, i.e. that there are some problems that are easily verified but not easily solved.

  ### Goal

  This project (rather ambitiously) hopes to distill [a non-constructive proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_proof) which shows that %P = NP%.

  ### Significance

  The development of a reliable %P = NP% proof would have huge consequences for computer science techniques. The methods involved with showing %P = NP% would lead to very efficient ways of solving %NP% problems, which rely heavily on trial-and-error solutions. Often times, algorithms will test millions or billions of answers before finding a match. Discovering a %P = NP% proof would effectively short-circuit this process.

  Important algorithms involving this level of trial-and-error include everything from route-finding in mapping services, to decrypting secure cyphers, to predicting protein structures. Many pieces of software work around the inefficiencies of %NP%-complete problems, but providing quick ways of solving these problems could lead to a whole new era of development in the computer sciences.

  ### About the Problem

  First mentioned in a letter between Kurt Gödel to John von Neumann, Gödel asked whether a certain %NP%-complete problem could be solved in quadratic or linear time. The precise statement of the P versus NP problem was introduced in 1971 by Stephen Cook in his seminal paper "The complexity of theorem proving procedures."
