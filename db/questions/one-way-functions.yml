  Can one-way functions truly exist, or is perfect cryptography impossible?
description: |
  One-way functions are fundamental tools for cryptography, personal identification, and other data security applications. While the existence of one-way functions in this sense is also an open conjecture, there are several candidates that have withstood decades of intense scrutiny.
significance: |
  Cryptography is built on the basis of one-way functions. Many modern applications are made of these principlesâ€”everything from securely storing passwords to ensuring you can access your bank's website without your browsing session being hijacked by someone else.
